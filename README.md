# DOTFILES

This is a work in progress.

## What needs to be done

1. Get a lot of nice keybindings
1. Add currently playing song to statusbar
1. Customize the statusbar
1. **Add some setup scripts to easily get going**
1. Write some docs to even more easily get going

## Feel free to contribute or open an issue

If there's any problem, try and read the corresponding log and open an issue about it.

I will add more troubleshooting when the repo has some scripts for getting started.
